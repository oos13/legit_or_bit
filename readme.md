## **Legit or Bit** 	

    is it legit or a bit?

Legit or Bit is a fact checking service bot that lives in Whats App. This bot is designed for those who have Meta subsided internet plans. These plans offer extra gibibytes or unlimited data for Meta products **ONLY**. It is unreasonable to expect people without easy and reliable internet access to be meticulous and thorough in verifying the veracity of the information they receive. So this tool offers those who have these plans a way to fact check websites and claims that may be shared to them or they may have themselves; without the risk of overages and charges on their phone plans.
We are powered by the Claim Busters Fact Checking API created by The University of Texas at Arlington. Which scores all user submissions. We also provide similar articles and information for article submissions which is done by contacting the Google Fact Explorer API.  

This Project was created by Danny Jaramillo and Omar Stevens as their Senior Capstone Project for The City College of New York

Install Ngrok at https://ngrok.com/

Download their provided `Ngrok.exe`

Run it and make sure your account is verified ✅

Open Ngrok.exe

type in the command `ngrok.exe http 80` to get it running

Copy the Forwarding address 

* It should look something like this: 'https://some_numbers_yada_yada.ngrok.io'

Login to Twilio page and go to: 
	
* Messaging in the side bar ➡ Senders ➡ WhatsApp Senders ➡ Scroll down to our WhatsApp number and click it. 🖱

## Sample Images

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44910053/207897300-d785c3bd-6133-4753-beb6-b127c12bd59e.png" width=40% height=40%>   <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44910053/207901492-76fa2009-43e9-4ce4-a2fa-cb752ea5a4e6.jpg" width=40% height=40%>

## Notes:

This application is still in testing and production, if you the user or developer messages the number provided above without having the Ngrok tunnel set up, you will recive no output. The tunnel currently is the only way we have connection to our code base.

We currently can not process images, for the future we want to have that service added to our project. 

We do accept images, but it will be used for future developments in fact checking them.

Our plan:

Information to send the user about the image:
		
		Meta Data
		
		If the image was altered
		
		Original source (done via reverse image search)
		
We also would like to find an additional service to provide professionaly facted checked articles. Since the Google Fact Check Explorer is very limted.
		
		This can be in the form of a API
		
		Or Simply a large dataset we can match similar queries and pull out of.
		
If you would like to add to out project, shoot us a message. We would love colaborators and fresh new ideas added to this service.
So we may all together help those with limited internet access!!
